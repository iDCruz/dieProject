dieProject
==========

This is a series of projects that I had to do for my OOD course (3rd semester). 

Simulate rolling a die x amount of times

record # of times each side is rolled 

simulate a histogram to represent # of times each side is rolled

Each project does the same thing basically. However, implementation varies. 

First project: No general structure (no use of oo practices/concepts)

Second Project: Use of classes and objects. (Die class and histogram class)
